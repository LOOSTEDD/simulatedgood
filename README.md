video is created by combining png images (at fps 15) generated by matplotlib, using ffmpeg. 

# FILE
python files with animation SAcheck.py & tsp-check.py__
python files without animation facility SA.py & tsp.py__

# TSP-using-simulated-annealing
near optimal solution of Travelling salesman problem using simulated annealing with 2opt optimization and boltzman distribution equation to calculate probability

# To-Do
[1] use this method/or other more robust one and google maps to figure out best logistics for delivery/courier companies

# Feature
you can use your own data file or let the code generate some random samples for you, output/algorithm's solution at each iteration can be easily visualized with the animation

# Prerequisites
This requires ffmpeg or mencoder to be installed to run animation, matplotlib and numpy modules.
